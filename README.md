# Dodo

Dodo is a tool for organising Rebellions - which are peaceful, occupational protests. Its purpose is to allow Rebels to map out the organisational structure of their protest team, support internal communications, recruit volunteers into open roles, and broadcast information about the status of the Rebellion.
