If you're an administrator of a Local Group and you are logged in to the website (if in doubt, check for the following symbol in the top right of your screen <i class="fas fa-user-circle"></i>) then you should see an "Edit" button when you visit your Local Group, Rebellion or Event.

You will then be taken to the Administration page. At the top of this page is 4 tabs, each with a different function:

- **Edit Details** - Here is where you can update the description, starting and end dates, and other pieces of information. For Rebellions and Local Groups, this is also where you manage events and protest sites. See: [How do I update information and edit details?](#how)
- **Announcements** - Here is where you can make announcements about what is going on, which will notify everybody who is subscribed. See: [How do I make announcements?](#Announcements)
- **Administration** - Here is where you can view and manage who else is an administrator and what they can do. See [How do I view and manage administrators]()
- **Analytics** - This view will display how many subscribers and views you have.
- **View** - This will open the public page in a new tab, so you can see how your event will look to everyone else.
