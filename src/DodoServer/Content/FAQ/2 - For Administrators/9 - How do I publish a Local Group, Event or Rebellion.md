When you first create a new Local Group, Event or Rebellion (a "resource"), it won't be visible in search results for other people using the site. You can still view the page and see what it will look like, but this is intended to give you a chance to look over any information and fully set everything up before making it public. Please be aware that once you've published to the world, you cannot unpublish.

When you're ready to publish, visit the Administration Page for that resource.

The first tab of this screen is the "Edit Details" tab. At the top of this tab is the "Publish" checkbox.

Then, click the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to save your changes. Your resource is now published and will appear in search results. Your Administration Page "Edit Details" tab should now show the following message at the top:
