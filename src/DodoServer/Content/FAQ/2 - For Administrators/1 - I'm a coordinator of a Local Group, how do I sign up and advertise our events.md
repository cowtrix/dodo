- The name should be the location of the Local Group.
- Give a detailed description of your Local Group and how people can get involved. You can include any links by using the following format: \[My Link Text\]\(https://www.myurl.com\) will make a link that looks like [My Link Text](https://www.myurl.com)
- It's important to set the location of the Local Group, Event or Rebellion properly so people can find it. Search for a location using the Search <i class="fas fa-search"></i> bar in the top right corner of the map. This can be a city, town, or street address. You can also make smaller adjustments by dragging around the blue circle on the map.

When you first create your new Local Group, you'll be taken to the Administration Page for it. Your new Local Group won't be "published" yet, which means that it won't show up in search results yet. To find out more about how to publish your Local Group and make it viewable by the public, see [How do I publish a Local Group, Event or Rebellion](#foradministrators_howdoipublishalocalgroupeventorrebe).
