To register a new account, visit the [register page by clicking here.]({URL}/register)

Firstly, pick a username. This has to be all lowercase characters like "abcdefg" or numbers. You can also use underscores. For example, `my_cool_username`, `davidmiller`, `daisy_1993` are all valid usernames.
 
Secondly, you'll need to provide an email address to create a new account. You'll receive updates from us and manage your account with this email address. If you don't have an email or you're concerned about security, we recommend [Proton Mail](https://protonmail.com/), a secure and free email service.

Now, you'll need to provide a strong password. This has to be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one symbol - that's something like `$&".\#` or anything like that. We strongly recommend that you either use a password manager tool like [KeePass](https://keepass.info/), or generate a strong password using [an online utility](https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator).
