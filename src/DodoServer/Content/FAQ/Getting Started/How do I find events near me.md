Finding events happening near you is easy. If you go to the home page [here]({URL}), you'll see a few different ways to find things:

1. You can use the Search bar to look for things by their name, address, or description.
2. Click on a map marker to see what the event at that marker is called, and click again to go to the event.
3. Filter your search results by local group, rebellion, site or event.
4. Clicking here will show the closest results to your location on the map. This might ask you if you'd like to share your location with us, and if you'd like to use this feature you should accept.
