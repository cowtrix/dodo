One of the main purposes of {PRODUCT} is to update you when new events are organised around you, or when events that you're interested in change. Emails are the main way you will be notified when something happens. You can customize the emails you receive from us about these updates in a few ways.

When you see an event you are interest in, or a local group that is nearby, or anything else which you would like to be kept up to date on, you can visit that page and click the "Subscribe" button. This will add the event or group to your [My Subscriptions page,]({URL}/my-rebellion) which will look something like this:

The bell symbol (ðŸ””) next to each name tells you if you are subscribed or not. Not everything is going to show on this page - only things that you have subscribed to. If you want to receive email updates, the first thing you need to do is check that you have Email Notifications enabled in your [User Settings.]({URL}/settings)

Make sure the box to the right "Notifications" is ticked. If you needed to enable or click this box, then click the "Update My Details" button.
