{PRODUCT} is still being developed by a team of volunteers, and we appreciate your help in making sure we have the minimum amount of issues, bugs and errors. There are two options you have to report issues to the {PRODUCT} team.

**Option 1: Email**

You can send an email to [{SUPPORT_EMAIL}](mailto:{SUPPORT_EMAIL}?subject=Support%20Ticket). Use this option if you'd like to tell us about the issue privately or if you'd like support for your account specifically.

**Option 2: Github**

You can open a public issue on the website [Github project.](https://github.com/cowtrix/dodo/issues). This is better for complex or technical issues and if you don't mind your submission being public. You'll need a free Github account to open issues.

Please keep in mind that this is a volunteer-run project. We will do our best to respond to any support queries as quickly as possible.
